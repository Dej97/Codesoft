In my journey through various projects, I've delved into the realm of predictive modeling across different domains. Among the ventures I embarked upon, three significant projects stand out, each presenting unique challenges and avenues for exploration.

Movie Predictions - Data Science Internship
In one of my projects during a Data Science internship, I engaged in predicting movie ratings. The focus was on leveraging regression models to foresee movie ratings based on diverse features. Employing multiple regression and decision tree algorithms, I meticulously evaluated their performances. Ultimately, the regression models outshone others, demonstrating superior predictive capabilities in this domain.

Titanic Survival Prediction
Another enthralling project centered around predicting survival probabilities aboard the Titanic. Using logistic regression and evaluating its performance via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, I aimed to classify survival outcomes. The logistic regression model emerged as a perfect classifier, showcasing exceptional performance in predicting survival on the Titanic.

Iris Flower Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
My exploration extended to the realm of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) during the Iris flower classification project. Leveraging the Sequential model from Keras, specifically designed for neural networks, I ventured into predicting Iris flower species. The ANN model, with its inherent complexity, proved to be the most effective, yielding unparalleled performance in accurately classifying the Iris flower species.

These diverse projects not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of different modeling techniques across regression, classification, and neural networks. Through each project, I gained invaluable insights into the nuances of predictive modeling, refining my approach to tackle varied challenges in data analysis and predictive analytics.
